Inspired from fangames such as I Wanna be The Guy, in this game, you fight against one of Kirby's bosses, Marx. The player has simple controls: Jump, double jump and shoot. To win, the player must defeat Marx by landing shots when Marx is vulnerable, however Marx has various gruelling attacks that the player must dodge! This game also features customizable controls.

<h2>How to view code and play the game</h2>
Download Construct 2 along with the .capx file. Open the project and there will be 'Event Sheet' tabs at the top of the preview window. Each event sheet corresponds to its respective scene. To play, ensure you have the "Start Screen" tab selected and click the play button at the top left of the screen.

- <b>Default Controls (Customizable in Options):</b>
  - Directions (IJKL) - This was the most comfortable for me (my right arrow key was broken at the time of development).
  - Shoot (Spacebar)
  - Menu Navigation is with the arrow keys.

<h2>ðŸ’¥Attacks</h2>

- <b>Black Hole:</b>
  - Marx positions in the center and creates a black hole, attracting projectiles spawned randomly at the edges of the screen.

- <b>Cutter Burst</b>
  - Marx moves to the top of the screen and launches blades all around him repeatedly. Simultaneously, the player must dodge arrows that come at random heights from the sides.

- <b>Charge and Return</b>
  - Marx charges at the player at high speed, leaving the screen. After some time, Marx laughs, indicating his return, once again charging at the player from the left at high speed.

- <b>Rain of Paint</b>
  - Marx splits into two paint balls, and rises to the sky. From here, paint balls rain down which the player must dodge.

- <b>Laser Split</b>
  - Marx once again rises to the sky, this time dropping ice bombs that split to the sides upon touching the ground. During this, vertical lasers also appear, forcing the player to be aware of dodging three projectiles at once.

Once Marx's HP drops to 0, you win!
