# I-Wanna-Kill-The-Marx
First game ever created, made in Construct 2

Inspired from fangames such as I Wanna be The Guy, in this game, you fight against one of Kirby's bosses, Marx. The player has simple controls: Jump, double jump and shoot. To win, the player must defeat Marx by landing shots when Marx is vulnerable, however Marx has various gruelling attacks that the player must dodge! This game also features customizable controls.

<h2>ðŸ’¥Attacks</h2>

- <b>Black Hole:</b>
  - Marx positions in the center and creates a black hole, attracting projectiles spawned randomly at the edges of the screen.

- <b>Cutter Burst</b>
  - Marx moves to the top of the screen and launches blades all around him repeatedly. Simultaneously, the player must dodge arrows that come at random heights from the sides.
 
- <b>Charge and Return</b>
  - Marx charges at the player at high speed, leaving the screen. After some time, Marx laughs, indicating his return, once again charging at the player from the left at high speed.

- <b>Rain of Paint</b>
  - Marx splits into two paint balls, and rises to the sky. From here, paint balls rain down which the player must dodge.
 
- <b>Laser Split</b>
  - Marx once again rises to the sky, this time dropping ice bombs that split to the sides upon touching the ground. During this, vertical lasers also appear, forcing the player to be aware of dodging three projectiles at once.
